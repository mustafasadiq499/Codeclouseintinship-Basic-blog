<section><p><h3>5 useful tips to improve in web development: </h3><ol> 

<li>Master the Basics First
Focus on getting a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the core building blocks of the web. Don’t rush into frameworks before you're confident with the basics.</li>

<li>Build Real Projects
Apply what you learn by creating small projects like a portfolio, blog, to-do list, or weather app. Building real projects helps you understand how things work together in practice.</li>

<li>Use Developer Tools
Get comfortable with browser developer tools (like Inspect Element in Chrome). They help you debug your code, test designs, and understand how websites are structured.</li>

<li>Learn Responsive Design
Make sure your websites work well on all screen sizes. Learn about media queries, flexbox, and grid layout to create responsive designs.</li>

<li>Keep Practicing and Stay Updated
Web development keeps evolving. Follow blogs, YouTube channels, or websites like freeCodeCamp, MDN Web Docs, or CSS-Tricks to stay updated and keep learning.</li></ol>
